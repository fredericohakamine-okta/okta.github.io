# Policy API

> The Policy API is an {% api_lifecycle ea %} [release](/docs/api/getting_started/releases-at-okta.html).

The Okta Policy API enables an Administrator to perform policy and policy rule operations.  The policy framework is used by Okta to control rules and settings that govern, among other things, user session lifetime, whether multi-factor authentication is required when logging in, what MFA factors may be employed, password complexity requirements, and what types of self-service operations are permitted under various circumstances.

Policy settings for a particular policy type, such as Sign On Policy, consist of one or more Policy objects, each of which contains one or more Policy Rules.  Policies and rules contain conditions that determine whether they are applicable to a particular user at a particular time.

The policy API supports the following **policy operations**:

* Get all policies of a specific type
* Create, read, update, and delete a policy
* Activate and deactivate a policy

The policy API supports the following **rule operations**:

* Get all rules for a policy
* Create, read, update, and delete a rule for a policy
* Activate and deactivate a rule

## Policies

### Policy Evaluation

When a policy needs to be retrieved for a particular user, for example when the user attempts to log in to Okta, or when the user initiates a self-service operation, then a policy evaluation takes place.
During policy evaluation each policy of the appropriate type is considered in turn, in the order indicated by the policy priority.   Each of the conditions associated with the policy is evaluated.  If one or more of the conditions cannot be met, then the next policy in the list is considered.  If the conditions can be met, then each of the rules associated with the policy is considered in turn, in the order specified by the rule priority.  Each of the conditions associated with a given rule is evaluated.  If all of the conditions associated with a rule are met, then the settings contained in the rule and in the associated policy are applied to the user.  If none of the policy rules have conditions that can be met, then the next policy in the list is considered.

Policies that have no rules are not considered during evaluation, and will never be applied.

### Policy Types
Different policy types control settings for different operations.  All policy types share a common framework, message structure and API, but have different policy settings and rule data. The data structures specific to each policy type are discussed in the various sections below.

<a href="#OktaSignOnPolicy">Okta Sign On Policy</a>

<a href="#OktaMFAPolicy">Okta MFA Policy</a>

<a href="#GroupPasswordPolicy">Password Policy</a>

### Policy Priority and Defaults

### Default Policies

There is always a default policy created for each type of policy. The default policy applies to any users for whom other policies in the Okta org do not apply. This ensures that there is always a policy to apply to a user in all situations.

 - A default policy is required and cannot be deleted.
 - The default policy is always the last policy in the priority order. Any added policies of this type have higher priority than the default policy.
 - The default policy always has one default rule that cannot be deleted. It is always the last rule in the priority order. If you add rules to the default policy, they have a higher priority than the default rule. For information on default rules, see [Rules Model and Defaults](#RulesObject).
 - The `system` attribute determines whether a policy is created by a system or by a user.

### Policy Priorities

Policies and are ordered numerically by priority. This priority determines the order in which they are evaluated for a context match. The highest priority policy has a `priority` of 1.

For example, assume the following policies exist.

- Policy A has priority 1 and applies to members of the "Administrators" group.
- Policy B has priority 2 and applies to members of the "Everyone" group.

When policy is evaluated for a user, policy "A" will be evaluated first.  If the user is a member of the "Administrators" group then the rules associated with policy "A" will be evaluated.   If a match is found then the policy settings will be applied.
If the user is not a member of the "Administrators" group, then policy B would be evaluated.

### Policy Object
{: #PolicyObject }

The Policy model defines several attributes:

Parameter | Description | Data Type | Required | Default
| --- | --- | --- | ---
id | Identifier of the policy | String | No | Assigned
type | Policy type | Specifies the type of the policy, e.g. `OKTA_SIGN_ON` or `MFA_ENROLL` | Yes |
name | Name of the policy | String | Yes |
system | This is set to 'true' on system policies, which cannot be deleted. | Boolean | No | false
description | Description of the policy | String | No | Null
priority | Priority of the policy | Int | No | Last / Lowest Priority
status | Status of the policy: ACTIVE or INACTIVE | String | No | "ACTIVE"
conditions | Conditions for policy | <a href="#PolicyConditionsObject">Conditions Object</a> | No |
settings | Settings for policy | <a href="#PolicySettingsObject">Policy Settings Object</a> | No |
created | Timestamp when the policy was created | Date | No | Assigned
lastUpdated | Timestamp when the policy was last modified | Date | No | Assigned
_links | Hyperlinks | <a href="#LinksObject">Links Object</a> | No |


### Policy Settings Object
{: #PolicySettingsObject }

The policy settings object contains the policy level settings for the particular policy type.  Not all policy types have policy level settings.  For example, in Password Policy the settings object contains, among other items, the password complexity settings.   In Sign On policy, on the other hand, there are no policy level settings; all of the policy data is contained in the rules.  Each policy type section explains the settings objects specific to that type.


### Conditions Object
{: #PolicyConditionsObject }

The Conditions Object(s) specify the conditions that must be met during policy evaluation in order to apply the policy in question.   All policy conditions, as well as conditions for at least one rule must be met in order to apply the settings specified in the policy and the associated rule.  Policies and rules may contain different conditions depending on the policy type.  The conditions which can be used with a particular policy depends on the policy type.
See <a href="#Conditions">conditions</a>


### Links Object
{: #LinksObject }

Specifies link relations (See [Web Linking](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988)) available for the current policy.  The Links Object is used for dynamic discovery of related resources.  The Links Object is **read-only**.

Parameter | Description | Data Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | ---
self | The policy or rule | String | Yes |
activate | Action to activate a policy or rule (present if the rule is currently inactive) | String | Yes |
deactivate | Action to deactivate a policy or rule (present if the rule is currently active) | String | Yes |
rules | Action to retrieve the rules objects for the given policy | String | Yes |

## Rules
Each policy may contain one or more rules.  Rules, like policies contain conditions, which must be satisfied in order for the rule to be applied.

### Rule Priority and Defaults

### Default Rules

 - Only the default policy contains a default rule. The default rule cannot be edited or deleted.
 - The default rule is required and always is the last rule in the priority order. If you add rules to the default policy, they have a higher priority than the default rule.
 - The `system` attribute determines whether a rule is created by a system or by a user. The default rule is the only rule that has this attribute.

### Rule Priority

Like policies, rules have a priority which governs the order in which they are considered during evaluation. The highest priority rule has a `priority` of 1.
For example if a particular policy had two rules, "A" and "B" as below.

- Rule A has priority 1 and applies to RADIUS VPN scenarios.
- Rule B has priority 2 and applies to ANYWHERE (network connection) scenarios.

If a request came in from the Radius endpoint, the action in Rule A would be taken, and Rule B would not be evaluated.
This occurs because, even though requests coming from anywhere would match the ANYWHERE location condition of Rule B, Rule A has higher priority and is evaluated first.

      }
    }
  }
~~~

### Rules Object
{: #RulesObject }

The Rules model defines several attributes:

Parameter | Description | Data Type | Required | Default
| --- | --- | --- | ---
id | Identifier of the rule | String | No | Assigned
type | Rule type | `OKTA_SIGN_ON` or `PASSWORD` or `MFA_ENROLL` | Yes |
status | Status of the rule: `ACTIVE` or `INACTIVE` | String | No | ACTIVE
priority | Priority of the rule | Integer | No | Last / Lowest Priority
system | This is set to 'true' on system rules, which cannot be deleted. | Boolean | No | false
created | Timestamp when the rule was created | Date | No | Assigned
lastUpdated | Timestamp when the rule was last modified | Date | No | Assigned
conditions | Conditions for rule | <a href="#RuleConditionsObject">Conditions Object</a> | No |
actions | Actions for rule | <a href="#RulesActionsObject">Rules Actions Objects</a> | No |
_links | Hyperlinks | <a href="#RulesLinksObject">Links Object</a> | No |

### Actions Objects
{: #RulesActionsObject }

Just as policies contains settings, rules contain "Actions", which typically specify actions to be taken, or operations that may be allowed, if the rule conditions are satisfied.  For example, in Password Policy rule actions govern whether or not self-service operations such as reset password or unlock are permitted.   Just as different policy types have different settings, rules have different actions depending on the type of the policy they belong to.

### Conditions Object
{: #RuleConditionsObject }

The Conditions Object(s) specify the conditions that must be met during policy evaluation in order to apply the rule in question.   All policy conditions, as well as conditions for at least one rule must be met in order to apply the settings specified in the policy and the associated rule.  Policies and rules may contain different conditions depending on the policy type.  The conditions which can be used with a particular policy depends on the policy type.
See <a href="#Conditions">conditions</a>

### Links Object
{: #RulesLinksObject }

Specifies link relations (See [Web Linking](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988)) available for the current rule.  The Links Object is used for dynamic discovery of related resources.  The Links Object is **read-only**.

Parameter | Description | Data Type | Required |

## Type-Specific Policy Data Structures

## Okta Sign On Policy
{: #OktaSignOnPolicy }

Okta Sign On Policy controls the manner in which a user is allowed to sign on to Okta, including whether they are challenged for multifactor authentication (MFA) and how long they are allowed to remain signed in before re-authenticating.

>Note: Okta Sign On Policy is different from application sign-on policy, which determines the extra levels of authentication (if any) which must be performed before a specific Okta application can be invoked.
Application sign-on policy can&#8217;t be configured via the API.

### Policy Settings Data

Okta sign on policy does not contain policy settings data.  In the case of sign on policy all of the data is contained in the rules.

### Policy Conditions
The following conditions may be applied to Okta Sign On Policy
